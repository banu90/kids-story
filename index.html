            <h1>Murugan – the Hindu God of Tamil</h1> 
            <p>
                Murugan is hailed as ‘Thamizh kadavul’ — the Lord of Tamils by poets and Tamil cultural exponents 
                who take pride in the uniqueness of Tamil culture.<br>
                Murugan is a popular deity widely worshiped in Tamil Nadu and also in Kerala, Karnataka and Srilanka.
                Worship of Karthigeya or Subramanya (other names of Muruga) is rather sporadic in other parts and linguistic segments of India.
                Worship of Subramanya (or Shiva Kumar, the son of Lord Shiva) was in fact one of the formal religious sects recognized 
                and sanctified by Shri Shankaracharya and this sect was known as Koumaram. 
                As Shri Sankaracharya hails from Kerala, it is quite obvious that he was quite familiar with the tradition of worship of Muruga, 
                existing all along in the Hindu culture of the south.

                <h1>The Story of Muruga and Valli Married</h1>
                <p>Valli is the wife of Hindu God Muruga and the devotional hymn, Tirumurukarruppatai, narrates the love story 
                  of Muruga and Valli. Muruga, the Son of Lord Shiva and Parvati, is popularly known as Kartik in North India. 
                  He is the commander of the Gods and is one of the most popular deities in Dravidian culture.<br>
                  legend has it that Nambi, a tribal chief, who was blessed with many sons longed for a girl child.
                  Once Nambi stumbled upon a hole that was dug to find roots and yams in the forest. In the hole he found 
                  a beautiful girl child and she was named Valli as she was found in the hole dug for yams and roots. 
                  The tribal chief brought her up as his daughter and she grew up to be a beautiful young lady.<br>                  
                  Young Valli was assigned with the duty of guarding the millet farm of the tribe. Lord Muruga <br>
                  who was residing on the Palani hills came to know about the beauty of Valli from Sage Narada.<br>
                  
                  Muruga took the form of a young hunter and tried to impress Valli. But she was hesitant and their 
                  first meeting was interrupted by the arrival of Nambi and his sons. Muruga took the form of a tree 
                  and went unnoticed.<br>
                  
                  Muruga then took the form of an old man and asked her for food. She fed him. Satisfied with her, 
                  the old man asked her to marry him. But she was hesitant.<br>
                  
                  Suddenly a rogue elephant came to the scene and a scared Valli took refuge in the arms of the old man. 
                  Muruga then revealed his true form and Valli was happy to be the beloved of Muruga. Legend has it that 
                  Lord Ganesh took the form of the rogue elephant to help His brother.<br>
                  
                  Muruga and Valli continued to meet in the millet field and their love blossomed. Soon the harvest time 
                  approached and Valli was taken back to the village by Nambi, the tribal chief. Nambi’s wife soon found out 
                  that Valli was in love with someone but she would not divulge his name.<br>
